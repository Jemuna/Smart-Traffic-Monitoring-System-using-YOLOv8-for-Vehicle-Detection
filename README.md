# Smart-Traffic-Monitoring-System-using-YOLOv8-for-Vehicle-Detection

Project Description:

This project utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time vehicle detection in traffic videos. It identifies various vehicles like cars, buses, trucks, and motorbikes, and displays their confidence score and type in the output video. The system allows for tracking of vehicle count and detection of congestion levels.

Technologies Used:

YOLOv8 (for real-time vehicle detection)
OpenCV (for video processing)
Python (primary language)
Ultralytics (YOLOv8 model wrapper)
